# Model .roh file for Rohan automation written by Jeff for Justin on July 5, 2012
# Rohan will always look for rohan.roh unless instructed to look for other config files by CLI
# 
# Blank lines and lines beginning with # are ignored by Rohan.
# Instructive lines are in the form of 'keyword=value' and
# are processed into a variable map.

# samples' value specification = name of the text file that contains the comma, tab, or space delimited lines of sample tuples
samples=AirplanePsDN1W3S10k.txt

# weights' value  specification = name of the file that contains the binary representation of the neural weights
weights="AirplanePsDN1W3S10kRMSE876.wgt"

# network's value specification is < # sectors, # inputs, size of first hidden layer or 0, size of second hidden layer or 0, # of outputs >
network=<384,9,54,0,1>

# eval's value specification is <1/0 for numbering tuples in sequence, 1/0 for including tuple's input values, 1/0 for including tuple' output values, # of tuples to include in evaluation/prediction>
eval=<1,1,1,10000>

# learn's value specification is < target RMSE, MAX, # of samples used, warp factor > Warp 1 is always safe, use other values at your own risk!!
learn=<9.5,10,10000,1>

# the tag value is a name used to identify the files Rohan generates during a session. Rohan's reply will be NahorNahor.han, reports will be NahorNahor937Evals.txt, etc.
