# Model .roh file for Rohan automation written by Jeff for Justin on July 5, 
# 2012, revised August 12.
# Rohan will always look for rohan.roh unless instructed to look for other 
# config files by CLI args.
# 
# Blank lines and lines beginning with # are ignored by Rohan.
# Instructive lines are in the form of 'keyword=value' and
# are processed into a variable map.

# Treat samples as a time series, giving <# of lines in sample file to be used
# as data, 1/0 for ordered from bottom to top, # of values taken from each 
# line, 1/0 for read right to left, 1/0 for discrete/continuous values, # of 
# lines to combine into 1 sample, line stride (increment) between samples>
# OPTIONAL

tseries=<8000,0, 2,0, 1, 100,1>

# samples' value specification = name of the text file that contains the 
# comma, tab, or space delimited lines of sample tuples. REQUIRED

samples=AirplanePsDN1W3S10k.txt

# continuity/discreteness of inputs, outputs, internal activation, final 
# activation. OPTIONAL

conty=<1,0,1,0>

# weights' value  specification = name of the file that contains the binary 
# representation of the neural weights. OPTIONAL

weights="JustinRmse000.WGT"

# network's value specification is < # sectors, # inputs, size of first 
# hidden layer or 0, size of second hidden layer or 0, # of outputs >.
# REQUIRED

network=<384,9,54,0,1>

# eval's value specification is <1/0 for numbering tuples in sequence, 1/0 
# for including tuple's input values, 1/0 for including tuple' output values, 
# qty of tuples to include in evaluation/prediction, beginning sample idx>. 
# OPTIONAL

eval=<1,1,1,10000,0>

# learn's value specification is < target RMSE, MAX, # of samples used, warp 
# factor, iterations per epoch, qty of epochs for learning>. Warp 1 is always
# safe, use other values at your own risk!! Training is saved at the end of
# each epoch; epoch durations depend on network and sample sizes. OPTIONAL

learn=<9.5,10,10000,1,500,2000>

# the tag value is a name used to identify the files Rohan generates during 
# a session. Rohan's reply will be NahorNahor.han, reports will be 
# NahorNahor937Evals.txt, etc. OPTIONAL

tag=NahorNahor
